              <p><strong>Fortune</strong>: This year will be all about treating yourself! Self-care, savor success, and enjoy every moment. This is the time to explore the desires of your heart and you will enjoy it to the fullest! </p>
              <p><strong>Reflection</strong>: This year I learned how to be more selfish with my desires. I was less afraid to speak up for what I wanted. I was able to trust more in myself and my own abilities, which shows phenomenal growth from the previous years.  </p>
              <p><strong>What was the last year about for you?</strong>: Finding myself, being selfish with my desires and getting what I want. Not being afraid to ask or get what I want.  </p>
              <p><strong>What were the lessons learned?</strong>: Not everyone has your best interest in hand, so always make sure you take care of you first. Always take care of people that are important to you, and they will do the same for you back. </p>

              <p><strong>What were the things lost?</strong>: Being not great at keeping up with people, I lost some very close friends that I hold dear. I miss Elsie, Ryan, Kyle, Kasha, and Derick. I also lost the chance of getting a better job, due to feelings of obligations at my last one.  </p>
              <p><strong>What were the things gained?</strong>: Indescribable trust and positive trust/branding from other people. </p>
              <p><strong>What were the things change?</strong>: I would try to be more aggressive for fighting for opportunities for me to grow. </p>
              <p><strong>What was the wish of the year?</strong>: Put yourself first and go and get the desires of your heart! </p>
              <p><strong>What was your favorite dish?</strong>: Salad, fries, and a cocktail at The Table at Oakbrook Terrace. </p>
